bio: I’m a developmental psychologist with a background in early causal
  reasoning and philosophy. Currently, I work between
  [Harvard](https://dev.cocodev.org), [UC
  Berkeley](http://www.gopniklab.berkeley.edu), and
  [UCSD](http://elc-lab-ucsd.com) on projects investigating children’s ability
  to generate and reason about new possibilities. By studying the development of
  the human cognitive abilities that enable us to pretend that bananas are
  telephones, I seek to gain purchase on a set of theoretical questions
  concerning the relation between concepts, action, and modal cognition.

Animals must act to live. Unlike plants with roots and leaves, we must move around to close the gap between ourselves and the things we need. Poetically, this involves something like being "the change you wish to see": we imagine possibilities for making differences in the world, and through our actions we make them fact. 

Now, 'imagining possibilities' means something very different for humans and hummingbirds, and that is a mystery perhaps too deep to tap. But 'imagining possibilities' also means something very different for 3-year-olds and 8-year-olds, and *that* we can study in the lab. When children play and imagine things, what types of new possibilities do they like to explore? Which real-world rules do they keep, and which do they bend? (And, how do they bend them?) How do they distinguish "actualities," facts, from non-actualities--i.e., mere possibilities or ideations? 

Viewed from a "human development" perspective, these questions are first of all, *very* fun. They are also clearly important for understanding adult cognition. (After all, major aspects of our shared social reality--like money, property, and summer vacations--might be characterized as elaborate forms of 'games,' 'play,' and 'pretense' writ large.) 

But viewed through an ecological lens, and from the perspectives of the evolution of cognition and philosophy of mind, the developmental elaboration of children's imaginative abilities form a rich case study for understanding the ways in which animals become skilled at recognizing and generating opportunities for action in their environment. By exploring ways to model these processes computationally, we may gain insight into a universal, formal structure that enables any cognitive system to solve these most (biologically) deep and important problems.
