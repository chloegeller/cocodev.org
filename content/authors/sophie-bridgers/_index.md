bio: >-
  I study the cognitive underpinnings of social decision-making and prosocial
  action. I conduct behavioral experiments with infants and young children and
  draw inspiration from computational modeling to formalize and test
  hypotheses. I am currently a visiting PhD student from Stanford where I work
  with Dr. Hyo Gweon and look forward to joining CoCoDev officially as a
  post-doc in the spring.
