bio: How do humans learn so much, so quickly? One answer to this question comes
  from recognizing that young children learn not only from their own
  exploration, but also from the testimony and evidence provided by *other
  people*. I scrutinize the role of social information in shaping and
  constraining children's inferences through empirical work with children and
  adults, and with computational models that formally capture these cognitive
  processes.
