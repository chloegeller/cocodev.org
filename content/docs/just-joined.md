## Getting yourself on the website

1. Make sure you have a GitHub account. If you don't have one, head over
   [here](https://github.com/join).

1. Once you've done that, come back head over to the {{% staticref "admin" %}}
   Admin panel{{% /staticref %}}
   You'll be prompted to login with GitHub, please do so. Now, you'll want to
   create a new "Member" and fill out as much, or as little about yourself as
   you'd like. Once complete, click "Publish" and this will open a Pull Request
   on GitHub. **We also use this to invite you to the lab's GitHub.**

1. Navigate to the [Members]({{< ref "members" >}}) page to verify you show up
   as expected. Additionally, look at your profile to ensure the accuracy of
   what's displayed on the website! :smiley:

This will be your profile on the website and will be cross-linked with
publications, projects, and posts that are made on this website.

{{< alert info >}}
If you ever want to make edits to your profile on the website, please use the
**Admin panel**. Then click "Publish" to submit a Pull Request on to the site.
This eases everyone's life as the panel gets around locally cloning and the
like.
